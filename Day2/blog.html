  <div id="content"> <h2>Environmental Pollution 101</h2>
    <p>Environmental pollution is an unfortunate result of our modern day lives.
         We need to come together to solve the worst impacts of environmental pollution by sorting out the need for environmental health protections with the need for commerce and everyday
         
         Finding the right balance to manage environmental issues can be hard, but it’s up to people like you and me to do our part in our everyday lives while pushing for real change on a much bigger scale. 
         I’ve laid out some basics on this page; I’ve rightly called it Environmental Pollution 101.</p></div>
   
  
    <h2>Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS)</h2><img src="http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gasfumes-150x150.jpg" alt="loading">
    <div class="para1">
     
    <p>Hazardous air pollutants are pollutants that are recognized or presumed to cause cancer and/or other other major health issues including birth defects and other reproductive effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with tribal, local, and state governments to help decrease the amount of toxics released into the environment. 
        The EPA has recognized 187 pollutants as the most harmful to human and environmental health.
         Some examples of those pollutants are found in everyday products such as perchlorethlyene, which is typically emitted by non-green dry cleaning businesses, and benzene which is in gasoline.</p>

       <div class="para2"> Benzene, </strong>in particular, is especially hazardous in the Pacific Northwest of the United States with the highest levels in the nation. 
        This is due to higher than normal benzene content derived from Alaskan oils. Benzene is odorless and is a component of your gasoline. It is a dangerous pollutant and highly toxic in our air. People are generally exposed to vapors from benzene through breathing contaminated air or through skin exposure. 
        The federal government knows this problem can lead to cancer and other sicknesses. Because children don’t have fully developed immune systems, they are the most vulnerable to benzene fumes.</p></div>
